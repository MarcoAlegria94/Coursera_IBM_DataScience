# Coursera IBM DataScience

## The journey of Data science
The objective of this repository is presenting the journey that a Data Science project includes. 
In this path we will go through the step-by-step that a Data scientist can walk to find using different tools like Python, SQL, SciKit Learn among others. 
The steps of this journey can be resumed as follows:

- Web Scrapping or API connection and data extraction.
- Data wrangling using Pandas, Numpy.
- Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL(MySQL), Data Visualization(Matplotlib)

The archives are named on the order of the step-by-step requirements of the journey, where you can find the complete guide for each step.

Finally on the PDF file you can find the complete presentation that I have carefully curated to make the process more digestible and accessible. 
If you have time and want to learn more about my learning process, be my guest, and dive deeply into my journey! :D

Thank you for reviewing my repository :)

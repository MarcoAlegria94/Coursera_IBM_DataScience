# Coursera IBM DataScience

## Complete requirements for the final capstone
As part of the Data Science certification from IBM this repository will include the final Capstone of the certificate.
The archives are named on the order of the step-by-step requirements of the capstone, where you can find the complete guide for each step.

Finally on the PDF file you can find the complete presentation that I have carefully curated to make the process more digestible and accessible. 
If you have time and want to learn more about my learning process, be my guest, and dive deeply into my journey! :D

Thank you for reviewing my repository :)
